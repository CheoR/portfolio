          <b>Hi</b> My name is Cheo. I'm a Nashville-based developer.

        <p>
          I have been programming as a hobby on/off for years. I started with
          C++ in highschool and dabbled with a bit of other languages since
          then. In college, I used Prolog for a computational linguistics course
          where we{" "}

          Due to health reasons after graduating, I could no longer do Peace
          Corp on medical grounds, so I continued learning at a local community
          college and state school. Doing so taught me to plan, build, and
          automate tools which eased my workload in the
          transportation/logistics/freight shipping industries.

          . NSS reinforced my skillset and taught me to use the latest
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I like to catch up on (computational) linguistics,
          explore, and volunteer.

        <p>I look forward to collaborating with you on future endeavors.</p>
